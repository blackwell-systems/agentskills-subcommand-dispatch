# Scout-and-Wave: Parallel Agent Coordination

This is an example frontmatter showing how SAW declares triggers for context injection.

The `triggers:` block tells `scripts/inject-context` which reference files to load based on the user's prompt. For example:

- `/saw program execute "add caching"` matches `^/saw program` and injects `references/program-flow.md`
- `/saw amend --add-wave` matches `^/saw amend` and injects `references/amend-flow.md`

Prompts that don't match any trigger (e.g., `/saw wave`, `/saw scout`) inject nothing -- zero overhead.

Note: `failure-routing.md` is intentionally not triggered here. It's a mid-execution reference
loaded after agents report back, not at dispatch time. Broad keyword triggers (like "failure" or
"blocked") false-positive when the hook receives the expanded skill body, which contains those
words in its own instructions. Only dispatch-time references (subcommand routing) should use triggers.
